/*After each of the calls to write() in the following code, explain what the content of
the output file would be, and why:
fd1 = open(file, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
fd2 = dup(fd1);
fd3 = open(file, O_RDWR);
write(fd1, "Hello,", 6);
>Hello,
#first write to file
write(fd2, " world", 6);
>Hello, world
#fd1 and fd2 share the same offset and flags so it gets added after
lseek(fd2, 0, SEEK_SET);
write(fd1, "HELLO,", 6);
>HELLO, world
#the fd is seeked back to 0
write(fd3, "Gidday", 6);
>Gidday world
#fd3 is still at offset 0*/
