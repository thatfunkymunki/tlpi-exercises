Exercise 8-1
When we execute the following code, which attempts to display the usernames for two different user IDs, we find that it displays the same username twice. Why is this?
  printf("%s %s\n", getpwuid(uid1)->pw_name, getpwuid(uid2)->pw_name);
  
  
getpwuid() returns a pointer to static memory, so when you call it again, the previous struct that you are referencing gets updated as well. This code would display the name for uid2 twice.
