Exercise 10-1
Assume a system where the value returned by the call sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) is 100.
Assuming that the clock_t value returned by times() is a signed 32-bit integer,
how long will it take before this value cycles so that it restarts at 0? Perform
the same calculation for the CLOCKS_PER_SEC value returned by clock().


INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647

times() returns clock_t number of clock ticks
100 ticks per second
21474836.47 seconds or 0.6809625973 years to overflow clock_t

CLOCKS_PER_SEC = 1,000,000,000

clock() returns cpu time measured in ticks with 1,000,000 CLOCKS_PER_SEC
2147.483647 seconds or 0.596523235 hours to overflow clock_t
